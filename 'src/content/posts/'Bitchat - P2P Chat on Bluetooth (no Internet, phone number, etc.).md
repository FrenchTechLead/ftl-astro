Do not use for sensitive use cases, and do not rely on its security until it has been reviewed. Work in progress. Public local chat (the main feature) has no security concerns. A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth mesh networks. No internet required, no servers, no phone numbers. It's the side-groupchat. License This project is released into the public domain. See the LICENSE file for details. Features Decentralized Mesh Network: Automatic peer discovery and multi-hop message relay over Bluetooth LE End-to-End Encryption: X25519 key exchange + AES-256-GCM for private messages and channels Channel-Based Chats: Topic-based group messaging with optional password protection Store & Forward: Messages cached for offline peers and delivered when they reconnect Privacy First: No accounts, no phone numbers, no persistent identifiers IRC-Style Commands: Familiar /join, /msg, /who style interface Message Retention: Optional channel-wide message saving controlled by channel owners Universal App: Native support for iOS and macOS Cover Traffic: Timing obfuscation and dummy messages for enhanced privacy Emergency Wipe: Triple-tap to instantly clear all data Performance Optimizations: LZ4 message compression, adaptive battery modes, and optimized networking Setup Option 1: Using XcodeGen (Recommended) Install XcodeGen if you haven't already: brew install xcodegen Generate the Xcode project: cd bitchat xcodegen generate Open the generated project: open bitchat.xcodeproj Option 2: Using Swift Package Manager Open the project in Xcode: cd bitchat open Package.swift Select your target device and run Option 3: Manual Xcode Project Open Xcode and create a new iOS/macOS App Copy all Swift files from the bitchat directory into your project Update Info.plist with Bluetooth permissions Set deployment target to iOS 16.0 / macOS 13.0 Usage Basic Commands /j #channel - Join or create a channel /m @name message - Send a private message /w - List online users /channels - Show all discovered channels /block @name - Block a peer from messaging you /block - List all blocked peers /unblock @name - Unblock a peer /clear - Clear chat messages /pass \[password\] - Set/change channel password (owner only) /transfer @name - Transfer channel ownership /save - Toggle message retention for channel (owner only) Getting Started Launch bitchat on your device Set your nickname (or use the auto-generated one) You'll automatically connect to nearby peers Join a channel with /j #general or start chatting in public Messages relay through the mesh network to reach distant peers Channel Features Password Protection: Channel owners can set passwords with /pass Message Retention: Owners can enable mandatory message saving with /save @ Mentions: Use @nickname to mention users (with autocomplete) Ownership Transfer: Pass control to trusted users with /transfer Security & Privacy Encryption Private Messages: X25519 key exchange + AES-256-GCM encryption Channel Messages: Argon2id password derivation + AES-256-GCM Digital Signatures: Ed25519 for message authenticity Forward Secrecy: New key pairs generated each session Privacy Features No Registration: No accounts, emails, or phone numbers required Ephemeral by Default: Messages exist only in device memory Cover Traffic: Random delays and dummy messages prevent traffic analysis Emergency Wipe: Triple-tap logo to instantly clear all data Local-First: Works completely offline, no servers involved Performance & Efficiency Message Compression LZ4 Compression: Automatic compression for messages >100 bytes 30-70% bandwidth savings on typical text messages Smart compression: Skips already-compressed data Battery Optimization Adaptive Power Modes: Automatically adjusts based on battery level Performance mode: Full features when charging or >60% battery Balanced mode: Default operation (30-60% battery) Power saver: Reduced scanning when <30% battery Ultra-low power: Emergency mode when <10% battery Background efficiency: Automatic power saving when app backgrounded Configurable scanning: Duty cycle adapts to battery state Network Efficiency Optimized Bloom filters: Faster duplicate detection with less memory Message aggregation: Batches small messages to reduce transmissions Adaptive connection limits: Adjusts peer connections based on power mode Technical Architecture Binary Protocol bitchat uses an efficient binary protocol optimized for Bluetooth LE: Compact packet format with 1-byte type field TTL-based message routing (max 7 hops) Automatic fragmentation for large messages Message deduplication via unique IDs Mesh Networking Each device acts as both client and peripheral Automatic peer discovery and connection management Store-and-forward for offline message delivery Adaptive duty cycling for battery optimization For detailed protocol documentation, see the Technical Whitepaper. Building for Production Set your development team in project settings Configure code signing Archive and distribute through App Store or TestFlight Android Compatibility The protocol is designed to be platform-agnostic. An Android client can be built using: Bluetooth LE APIs Same packet structure and encryption Compatible service/characteristic UUIDs MacOS Want to try this on macos: just run will set it up and run from source. Run just clean afterwards to restore things to original state for mobile app building and development. About bluetooth mesh chat, IRC vibes Resources Readme License Unlicense license Uh oh!
