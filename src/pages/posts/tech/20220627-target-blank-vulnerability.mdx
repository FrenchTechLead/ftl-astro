If you are a web developer, It's very likely that you have used the `target="_blank"` attribute in your web application, regardless of the Framework or the templating language used, there is a good chance that you added this attribute to your HTML without considering the fact that this attribute might be unsecure.

## What Makes The target="_blank" attribute Unsecure?
When you add the `target="_blank"` attribute to your HTML, you are telling the browser that you want to open the link in a new tab, but you also give partial access to the linked page to the current page thanks to the `window.opener` JavaScript object.

### Example 1:
Let's consider the following HTML fragment in the page `https://my-site.com/` :

```html
<a href="https://other-site.com" target="_blank">Other Site</a>
``` 
In the above example the opened tab (`https://other-site.com`) will have access to the current page(`https://my-site.com/`), but the current page will not have access to the opened tab.


The newly opened tab can access all the `Window` Object of the openning tab, so it can do anything that the current page can do, like: redirection, html injection, etc.

### Example 2:
This vulnerability is also possible with JavaScript code:

```js
window.open("https://other-site.com", "_blank" );
```
the same thing happens here, the opened tab will have access to the current page, but the current page will not have access to the opened tab.

## How To Protect Yourself Against The target="_blank" Vulnerability?
To protect yourself against this vulnerability, you can use the following techniques:
### With HTML :
Add the following attribute to your HTML element:

```html
<a href="https://other-site.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other Site</a>
```
### With JavaScript :
Add the following code to your JavaScript file:

```js
window.open("https://other-site.com", "_blank", "noopener, noreferrer");
```
