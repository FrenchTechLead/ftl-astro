There is a ton of repetitive tasks that we can automate thanks to bots, in this article I’ll show you the easiest and the fastest way to build a bot using Python and Selenium 🚀🚀🚀.




1 . Download the Chrome Web Driver 🔨 :
---------------------------------------

Chrome web driver makes it possible to manage the browser using any programming language, here we will use Python.

*   First, [download the webDriver.](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
*   Second, unzip the chromedriver.zip file and copy the webDriver to a specified location: `cp chromeDriver /Library/webdrivers/chromeDriver`
*   Third, add the location of the webDriver to the `PATH` env variable :

```
export PATH="$PATH:/Library/webdrivers/"
```



2\. Install the Selenium package for Python 📦 :
------------------------------------------------

```
pip install selenium
```



3\. The Python code 🐍 :
------------------------

To execute the Python code and run the bot use the following command:

```
python simple-selenium-bot.py
```

The usage of the `sleep()`method is very common in these types of bots, it allows you to wait for a request to be sent or for the UI to be refreshed before continuing the execution of the program.

This is a simple bot program that shows you how Selenium works, there is a lot of real-world use cases out there to implement in order to gain time or productivity using Selenium, here are some bot ideas I worked on previously :

*   Checking the availability in a booking system.
*   Checking out the availability of a high demanding article in a marketplace.
*   End-to-end tests of a web application.
*   ….
